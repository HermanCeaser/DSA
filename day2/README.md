# Count and Say.

The [count-and-say](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say/) sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:

    countAndSay(1) = "1"
    countAndSay(n) is the way you would "say" the digit string from countAndSay(n-1), which is then converted into a different digit string
    .

To determine how you "say" a digit string, split it into the minimal number of substrings such that each substring contains exactly one unique digit. Then for each substring, say the number of digits, then say the digit. Finally, concatenate every said digit.\

For example, the saying and conversion for digit string "3322251":

## Given a positive integer n, return the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.

### Example 1

```
Input: n = 1
Output: "1"
Explanation: This is the base case.
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: n = 4
Output: "1211"
Explanation:
countAndSay(1) = "1"
countAndSay(2) = say "1" = one 1 = "11"
countAndSay(3) = say "11" = two 1's = "21"
countAndSay(4) = say "21" = one 2 + one 1 = "12" + "11" = "1211"
```

### Approach

- Below is the idea to solve the problem

---

The first term is "1"

Second term is "11", generated by reading first term as "One 1"
(There is one 1 in previous term)

Third term is "21", generated by reading second term as "Two 1"

Fourth term is "1211", generated by reading third term as "One 2 One 1" and so on

---

The idea is simple, we generate all terms from 1 to n. First terms is initialized as “1”and all other terms are generated using previous terms. To generate a term using the previous term, we scan the previous term. While scanning a term, we simply keep track of the count of all consecutive characters.
