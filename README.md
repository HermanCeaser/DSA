This repo contains common problems encountered in data structures and algorithms. The approach used to solve these problems and the solution to the problem.

This Repo will document my journey through data structures and i will be using [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) as a reference site for the problems that i attempt to do on a daily basis.

I will be using Javascript to solve these problems.

## Directory Structure:

- Day Directory i.e day1
  - README.md file about the problem, the constraints about the problem and the thought process to solve the problem.
  - An index.js that contains the solutions.
